Tuition fees at public and private institutions have risen year after year, burdening students and their families with higher and higher costs and, in many cases, loans."),
      p("While the average cost of attending college has consistently grown from under $10,000 per year in 2000/01 to nearly double that in 2023/24, the rate at which these price hikes have been implemented has not been even across the board. Public institutions, which benefit from some state and federal funding, have seen moderate increases in (out-of-state) tuition fees from an average of just over $5,000 per year in 2000 and reaching an average of $12,500 per year for the 2023/24 school year. While this is still a significant amount of money for many Americans, the cost of attending a private institution has always been, and remains to be, much higher."),

By the 2019/20 school year, that cost had climbed to over $25,000 per year, with over 200 of the 4,410 private institutions charging more than $50,000 per year. There was a small dip in the average cost for the 2019/20 school year, but prices continued to rise in subsequent years."),
      p("The sticker price of a college education, especially at a private institution, can be shocking, and while the cost is not a small sum for most students and their families, there is some hope on the horizon. When adjusted for inflation, the price of higher education has been slowly coming down in recent years. Between 2000 and 2019, the price increases were happening faster than inflation was changing real wages. Since then, however, the inflation-adjusted average cost at both public and private institutions has returned to levels not seen since 2010, or earlier."),

A slow decline in the first decade of the 21st century was followed by a slow rebound back to levels at the turn of the century.

The admission rates at these schools declined consistently from the 2001/02 admissions cycle and the 2019/20 cycle."),

The COVID-19 pandemic, a shift toward test-optional policies, and the increased access to applications through platforms such as the Common App likely exacerbated the long-term trend. More applicants for the same number of seats means lower acceptance rates, and schools have an incentive to keep them low to increase their perceived prestige."),

For schools with less selective admissions criteria, or more available seats, the competition for a space is not significantly different to what it has been over the last two decades.
